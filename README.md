# Global Distribution of Ylang Ylang
This repository contains my GIS project for the Spatial Data with R Module
Cananga odorata commonly known as 'Ylang Ylang' is a commercially important plant used in the health and wellness industry for cosmetics and aromatherapy. It is also thought to alleviate anxiety and depression. 
The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. This project maps the global distribution of Ylang Ylang to confirm its presense in native regions. By generating a map, the distribution of this unique and important plant can be visualized.
# Data Sources
The data was obtained from iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/). The species was searched and all observations worldwide were used. Of the 1026 total observations, the 1002 that had longitude and latitude coordinates were used to generate the map.
