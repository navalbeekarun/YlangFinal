# Global Distribution of Ylang Ylang
This repository contains my GIS project for the Spatial Data with R Module
Cananga odorata commonly known as 'Ylang Ylang' is a commercially important plant used in the health and wellness industry for cosmetics and aromatherapy. It is also thought to alleviate anxiety and depression. 
The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. This project maps the global distribution of Ylang Ylang to confirm its presense in native regions. By generating a map, the distribution of this unique and important plant can be visualized.
# Data Sources
The data was obtained from iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/). The species was searched and all observations worldwide were used. Of the 1026 total observations, the 1002 that had longitude and latitude coordinates were used to generate the map. 
# Project Outcome
The final map generated is an interactive map with a coordinate pop up system and a National Geographic base map. By interacting with the map, one can see that Ylang Ylang dominates in native Southeast Asia regions as those areas have the most observations.  There are also observations between Central America and South America as well as East Africa, covering the entirety of Madagascar. Lastly, there are also some observations in Australia. This shows that the plant is distributed in native regions as well as non-native (introduced regions). Itis likely that if is found in these places, because they all share a tropical climate.
